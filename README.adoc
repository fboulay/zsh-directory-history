Originally forked from https://github.com/tymm/zsh-directory-history[tymm repository]. +
The purpose of this fork is to make it work with https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen[antigen].

This plugins is based on https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search[history-substring-search] zsh plugin. It exposes the same functions : `history-substring-search-up` and `history-substring-search-down`

== DESCRIPTION

*zsh-directory-history* is a zsh plugin giving you a history which is sensitive to the directory you are in. +
It implements forward/backward navigation as well as substring search (as https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search[here]) in a directory sensitive manner.

Behavior:

* Commands executed in the current directory will pop up first when
navigating the history or using substring search.
* A substring unknown in the current directory, will be searched for
globally (it falls back to the normal substring search behavior).

Since the plugin creates its own history (in `~/.directory_history`), it needs some time to fill up and become useful.

== INSTALL

1.  With Antigen installed, add in your `.zshrc`:
+
[source,shell]
....
 antigen bundle fboulay/zsh-directory-history
....
2.  Bind keyboard shortcuts in your `.zshrc` +
`directory-history-search-forward`/`directory-history-search-backward`
needs to be bind for forward/backward navigation. +
`history-substring-search-up`/`history-substring-search-down` needs to
be bind for substring search. +
For example:
+
[source,shell]
....
